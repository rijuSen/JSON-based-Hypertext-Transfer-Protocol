# JSON-based-Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol
A system to transfer web pages over the network using client/server architecture.  The system consists of two main distributed components: server and client, which may run on diferent hosts in the network.  A server is a program that accepts multiple incoming TCP connections from clients and responds to requests sent by clients.  This system is called Json-based Hypertext Transfer Protocol (JHTTP) which is used by server and clients to communicate.  JHTTP has a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given web page. Please note that web pages are text files only.  This project is designed to use TCP Sockets. Server creates multiple threads and uses them to process clients' requests.  All the communicated messages between the server and clients must be encapsulated in the form of JSON messages.
